# How to use the bot?

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/auguwu/Nino/wiki)!

# Features

* Auto Moderation - Prevents raids, spam, ads and swears!
* Lockdown command - locks one, multiple or all channels for a specific role downwards
* Moderation commands - many moderation commands to simplify your moderators' work.
* Moderation Log and Cases - easy and organized way of seeing the actions done by you and your mods! 
* Advanced warning system and auto punishments - automatically punish those who commit offenses!

## Setting up the bot

1. Clone the repository using Git: ``git clone https://github.com/auguwu/nino``
2. Install dependencies with NPM (included in Node.js): ``npm i``
3. Create an application.yml file in your working directory (see the example for more information)
4. Compile TypeScript (install TypeScript with ``npm i -g typescript``): ``tsc``
5. Run the bot in the `dist` directory: ``node bot.js``
6. 4 and 5 can be bypassed by running npm run main.

Bot credentials (+ extra information) and personal touches are obviously your responsibility. You should know this by now, I hope.
